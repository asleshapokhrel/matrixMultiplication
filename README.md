# matrixMultiplication
I'll be doing some experimenting with parallelization and matrix 
multiplication. My intention is to implement matrix multiplication in a linear
and a parallel fashion and then compare the running times on several machines
to see what the performance differences are.

# Implementation
For this I will be writing some C code using standard libraries as well
as the pthread library.
